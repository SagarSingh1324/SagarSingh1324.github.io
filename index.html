        A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. 
        Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.

        A  paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. 
        A paragraph consists of three or more sentences.
        Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
